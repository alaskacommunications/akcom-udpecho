.SH NAME
akcom-udpechod - a simple UDP echo server

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBakcom-udpechod\fR [\fBOPTONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBakcom-udpechod\fR is simple UDP echo server. Currently \fBakcom-udpechod\fR
processes each packet sequentially which causes all packets received before
previous packets have been processed to be skewed when using either the
\fB-D\fR or \fB-d\fR options.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 10
\fB-d\fR \fInum\fR, \fB--drop\fR=\fInum\fR,
set the packet drop probability [0-99]. This option should not be used if
multiple clients will be using the same UDP echo server instance.
(default: 0%)

.TP 10
\fB-D\fR \fIusec\fR, \fB--delay\fR=\fIusec\fR
set echo delay range to microseconds. This option should not be used if
multiple clients will be using the same UDP echo server instance.
(default: 0 us)

.TP 10
\fB-e\fB, \fB--echoplus\fR
run as a TR-143 UDPEchoPlus server. This option is not compatible with
RFC 862 UDP echo clients.

.TP 10
\fB-f\fR \fIstr\fR, \fB--facility\fR=\fIstr\fR
set syslog facility (default: daemon)

.TP 10
\fB-g\fR \fIgid\fR, \fB--group\fR=\fIgid\fR
setgid to gid (default: none)

.TP 10
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
print this help and exit

.TP 10
\fB-l\fR \fIaddr\fR, \fB--listen\fR=\fIaddr\fR
bind to IP address (default: all)

.TP 10
\fB-n\fR, \fB--foreground\fR
do not fork

.TP 10
\fB-p\fR \fIport\fR, \fB--port\fR=\fIport\fR
list on port number (default: 30006)

.TP 10
\fB-P\fR \fIfile\fR, \fB--pidfile\fR=\fIfile\fR
PID file (default: /var/run/akcom-udpechod.pid)

.TP 10
\fB-r\fR, \fB--rfc\fR
run as an RFC 862 compliant echo protocol. This option may be incompatible
with TR-143 UDPEchoPlus clients.  This option is compatible with the TR-143
UDPEchoPlus mode of \fBakcom-udpecho\fR (8). (default)

.TP 10
\fB-u\fR \fIuid\fR,  \fB--user\fR=\fUuid\fR
setuid to uid (default: none)

.TP 10
\fB-v\fR, \fB--verbose\fR
enable verbose output

.TP 10
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
print version number and exit
