.SH NAME
akcom-udpecho - a shell utility for testing UDP echo servers

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBakcom-udpecho\fR [\fBOPTONS\fR] \fIhost\fR [\fIport\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBakcom-udpecho\fR is a shell utility for testing UDP echo servers.
\fBakcom-udpecho\fR supports for RFC 862 compliant servers and TR-143
UDPEchoPlus compliant servers.  If the UDP Echo variant is not specified,
\fBakcom-udpecho\fR will attempt to determine the variant by examining the
\fITestRespSN\fR, \fITestRespRecvTimeStamp\fR, and \fITestRespReplyTimeStamp\fR
 fields of the UDPEchoPlus packet for non-zero values.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP 14
\fB-4\fR
connect via IPv4 only

.TP 14
\fB-6\fR
connect via IPv6 only

.TP 14
\fB-c\fR \fIcount\fR
stop after sending count packets

.TP 14
\fB-d\fR, \fB--debug\fR
print headers of received packets. Useful for troubleshooting remote
UDPEchoPlus servers.

.TP 14
\fB-e\fR, \fB--echoplus\fR
expect responses from a TR-143 UDPEchoPlus compliant server. The default is to
attempt to detect UDPEchoPlus responses.

\fB-i\fR \interval\fR
interval in seconds between sending packets (default: 1 sec)

.TP 14
\fB-r\fR, \fB--rfc\fR
expect responses from an RFC 862 compliant server . The default is to
attempt to detect TR-143 UDPEchoPlus responses.

.TP 14
\fB-q\fR, \fB--quiet\fR, \fB--silent\fR
do not print messages

.TP 14
\fB-s\fR \isize\fR
size of data bytes to be sent. The minimum data size is 40 bytes.
